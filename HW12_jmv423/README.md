### Part 1: Download and Merge Data

1. With the provided function to query from Carto, I used the query below to get data and group by zipcodes.
2. I then downloaded a NYC zipcode shapefile and loaded it to a geodataframe.
3. I subsequently extracted the centroids and their coordinates.
4. I then did an inner merge on the zipcodes of the asthma data and the shapefile.
5. Lastly, I plotted the asthma points over the original zipcode data.
